				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">I stumbled through the dark, struggling to grasp onto anything safe or familiar. I searched ravenously for a way to fix myself. I had deviated too far from my society’s “norms”, and I didn’t feel like I could please anyone. I continued to look in the mirror, but I didn’t see my reflection. I wasn’t seeing myself. I just saw how different I was from the rest; from my friends and family or even the strangers that strolled past me day by day. The face that I saw staring back at me offered no help to my pitiful situation. </p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">I wasn’t exactly fond of these crude thoughts, but I had not control over them. I felt discontent and lost. I reached out and felt the brush of his fingertips. He pulled me in forcefully and reassured me that the direction he would lead me towards would be better than the one I had been taking for so long. I listened closely and put my trust forth. He told me, “You don’t need these anymore”. All of my old drugs disappeared, and he gave me new ones. I started to see everything in somewhat of a distortion. He opened me up to so many new things. A pop of his pills, and I could feel myself slipping into the world that he wanted for me; closer to the life that he thought I needed. But I wasn’t the least bit phased because I was drenched by the transformations taking place right in front of me.</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">Never before had I noticed how the sky looked almost translucent on a bright day. Every note sang by the dainty sparrow was erupted into a sweet melody that filled my body. At night, I saw the stars, and they moved in a fashion that I was unfamiliar with. I tasted the rain that blanketed through every so often. I was curious to hear, see, taste, smell, and feel more. How had I never seen this life before?</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">It was all so great until I couldn’t sleep without recalling the smell of you on my pillow. I could remember the way it felt to be held so safely. But I was safe here in his world, right? But no matter what I did, I just couldn’t shake that nagging feeling. As I walked through each day, I had flashbacks of you. Some days, the same memories would repeat, and other days it would be something new. But what surprised me so much was that they were memories that I really had to tug at, I searched for them desperately. I should’ve been able to reminisce without feeling blocked. I could somehow envision the memories that he was slowly seeping from me. Everything had to be erased, but he was so discreet about it. Every change was so ordinarily subtle. I didn’t realize my world was fading. With every single cycle of the day, with the fall of the sun and the wading of the moon, I felt frightened. Was I forgetting myself in this mess? </p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">I’d always been so high on life, soaking up every detail, every flavor. I used to wake up and immediately breathe in the beautiful and gloomy air, saturated with fog and mist from the previous night’s storm. I used to trace over every pattern swirled in the dark clouds. Every breath that I would take in was a little deeper, letting the smell of wildflowers infest my lungs completely. The aftertaste of that tiny pill allowed me to sense it all. I used to be so ambitious, so sure, such a dreamer. I had always known that one day; I would know exactly who I wanted without having to even think about it. My high, my rush, that little extra push, had always kept me addicted to living. I just needed some guidance, something to cradle me or to spark inside of me so that I could get away from him. I needed to escape. So I did it. On that night, I ran.</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">I was done complying, I was ready for flight. I hoped for one thing only, and that was to hear your voice tell me that I was your home. I felt you dry my tears, and I suddenly tasted the way it used to be when I kissed your skin. I felt you so ubiquitously. It was so intense and perplexing. I wanted to feel every bit of it, I really did. But something tried holding me back, the comfort of being protected, guarded, and swept away by him day after day. He was safe because every mistake I ever made in his world didn’t exist. Every temptation and wrongdoing was somehow evaded. Those were the days where I couldn’t think or feel for myself unless it benefitted him as well. It all felt so fake and processed. He was the sensible choice. He was the safe choice. But he wasn’t the better one.</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">In a split second, I knew which world I belonged in. He couldn’t make me look back. I kept moving swiftly. Every hour that trudged by brought me back to the person that I couldn’t be around him. I never loved him; I loved the stability of it all. But stability is meaningless without happiness. I ran, I broke free, and I swallowed every last pill that I had saved. And the world came flushing back so quickly. I found myself sitting in front of a large body of water. I had been running with so much in my head that I didn’t notice until now that it was completely dark. I saw so much from so little.</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">To my left side, I gazed at a bridge being held up by several sturdy pillars. In between some of the pillars were lights. Only one blinked continuously; the rest were green, blue, red, and orange dots that danced on the dark horizon. Every so often, a car would drive across the bridge, and the headlights lit up all of the reflector strips, one by one. I’d watch each small strip light up as the car moved across, like a stack of dominoes collapsing into each other. Eventually, the car would pass, and the lights would sleep once again. A car would come from the opposite way and the reflector strips lit up, not as brilliantly. But I’d still watch each one pass the light to the next until the car disappeared. At one point, I even saw two cars approaching each other from different directions and the luminescent strips converged when they passed.</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">I circled my eyes upward and saw a dark sky dotted with clouds. They weren’t heavy, but my view of the stars was obscured. On both of my sides, there were lifeless trees with their rough branches painting a sharp landscape. The rocks underneath me were all different sizes, most of them made up a sort of soft gravel that I sank into. I threw some larger rocks into the water, waiting for the splash to bounce back on my face. I tasted the earthy water, and I smelled the murkiness of it as well. I could hear the water gently pull at the conglomerate shore, just the simplest oscillation of the water kissing my feet. I laid back and shivered at the slight chill of the wind; the wind that I hadn’t felt or been able to love in so long. I saw that wind pushing back at the clouds, and the sky showed off it dazzling light show of stars.</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 6%;">I saw the constellations, and I thought of the lives that were lived and lost as their bodies floated into the sky. I looked into the water and saw how closely the rocks lay on the shallow shore. But I saw them drop off after a few feet, and I knew someone had used this place to leave the earth at some point. I almost felt the heaviness of their lungs as they filled with the clouded water. I was scared for a lapse, but I whipped out of that thought. I felt the solemn death in that place, but I knew that now was the time to live. It was time to live for myself, because that’s the problem with so many people these days. They base their happiness on the way others perceive them, on someone else’s happiness (or possibly the lack thereof). When was the last time you were happy because you did something for yourself? I spent too much time being miserable to make him happy. I had thought that I would find myself as I found him, but I just ended up lost. These were the sacrificed made to prove to him that I could love normally, that I wasn’t irreversibly damaged. </p>

Those who have met her know she has this way of allowing people to open up, to laugh and to smile. Whatever hardships may come, she'll find a way to adapt to the situation and overcome it. Her writings and camera work embody her beauty and resolve, and people can get a sense of both of these qualities just by being in her presence. She makes a mean bowl of chicken tortilla soup and her smile can light up an entire room like Christmas lights on a cold, December night.
